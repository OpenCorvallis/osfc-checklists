# Fabricating the checklists

The checklists are printed and laminated at the FedEx Office Print and Ship
Center on 9th street in Corvallis.

## Overview of the fabricating process

1. Print out the checklists, double-sided.
1. Trim the paper edges and cut down the middle.
1. Laminate the checklist pages.
1. As soon as the laminator stops, fold the paper over.
1. Hold down on the crease for several seconds as the lamination cools.
1. For the multi-sheet checklists, bind the sheets together using a booklet
stapler.

## Paper selection

Higher-weight paper is less transparent, which makes it easier to read under
strong light conditions. However, higher-weight paper is more difficult to
laminate and fold.

The printers are loaded with 20 lb paper. You can purchase higher weights from
them (I know 32, 60, and 80, and 100 are available, I think there are others
too). The printers can do double-sided printing on up to 80 lb paper, but
anything higher than that must be printed one side at a time. You can laminate
up to 100 lb paper. If you print in 100 lb paper, use the "heavy 6" preset
(heavy 6 and heavy 7 both support 100 lb paper, I asked them which to use).

Cutting where the crease will be and separating the sheets makes the fold
possible with heavier paper. Weirdly, it seems that having the sides closer
together (shrinking the gap between the paper) works better?! I don't know for
sure (haven't done enough testing). Maybe we don't even need a gap, just slice
the paper and put the parts adjacent to each other?

So far, I've gotten the best results with 80 pound paper. Print double-sided,
then trim the edges and cut down the middle, then laminate. I think 100 pound
paper can work, but I'll have to rotate every other page in the PDF to make the
prints line up with single-sided printing.

There are some special procedures for the higher-weight printer (both to
convince it to feed the paper from the external feed slot, and to tell it that
it is printing on heavy paper).

## Paper edge trimming

For some reason, the printer didn't do a very good job of centering the contents
in the page. So far, I've never seen it miss far enough to be a problem (my
margins seem to be adequate), but it does look bad and leaves some of the
margins very large. I use their straightedge cutter to trim off the extra space
before laminating.

## Lamination technique

Double-check the laminator is set to 4.5 (that's normally what it's left at).
Make sure you orient the page in the orientation that will make the fold
easiest; both to make the fold more expedient and to avoid accidentally folding
the checklist in the wrong direction. After putting the paper into the plastic
and then into the paper sleeve, slide your hands on top to remove air bubbles
from the plastic. After feeding the sleeve into the laminator
(creased-end-first), gently tug on the open end of the sleeve as if you want to
slow down its motion through the laminator. The employees there say that helps
to remove air and improve the lamination quality.

The folding technique I use is to line up the corners, then press one hand down
on the non-creased side (to prevent the corners from moving -- needs significant
force with 60 lb paper) then press vertically down on the other side to create
the crease. I slide fingers up and down the crease (on both sides) to make it as
sharp as possible, then lay the length of my hand down the crease while it
finishes cooling.

## Binding technique

Get some practice on non-laminated paper before using a booklet stapler, as it
is easy to miss the center of the spine (there's no marking on the staplers I've
seen that show exactly were the staple will come out).

I start in the center of the spine, then move towards one side. I then reset
back towards the center and work towards the other side.
