# Fabricating the checklists

The checklists are printed and laminated at the FedEx Office Print and Ship
Center on 9th street in Corvallis.

## Overview of the fabricating process

1. Print out the checklists, double-sided.
1. Trim the paper edges.
1. Laminate the checklist pages.
1. As soon as the laminator stops, fold the paper over.
1. Hold down on the crease for several seconds as the lamination cool.
1. For the multi-sheet checklists, bind the sheets together using a booklet
stapler.

## Paper selection

The printers are loaded with 20 lb paper. You can purchase higher weights from
them (I know 32, 60, and 80 are available, I think there are others too). The
printers can do double-sided printing on up to 80 lb paper, but anything higher
than that must be printed one side at a time.

Higher-weight paper is less transparent, which makes it easier to read under
strong light conditions. However, higher-weight paper is more difficult to fold.
Some experimentation showed that 80 lb paper is very difficult to fold, and it
results in some amount of delamination during the folding process.

So far, it looks like 60 lb paper is the best fit: it is somewhat difficult to
fold, but in the end it seems to work well and it is considerably more opaque
than the 20 lb paper.

There are some special procedures for the higher-weight printer (both to
convince it to feed the paper from the external feed slot, and to tell it that
it is printing on heavy paper).

## Paper edge trimming

For some reason, the printer didn't do a very good job of centering the contents
in the page. So far, I've never seen it miss far enough to be a problem (my
margins seem to be adequate), but it does look bad and leaves some of the
margins very large. I use their straightedge cutter to trim off the extra space
before laminating.

Maybe I should try a different printer in the future (I used the one on the
north wall closest to the west).

## Lamination technique

Double-check the laminator is set to 4.5 (that's normally what it's left at).
Make sure you orient the page in the orientation that will make the fold
easiest; both to make the fold more expedient and to avoid accidentally folding
the checklist in the wrong direction. After putting the paper into the plastic
and then into the paper sleeve, slide your hands on top to remove air bubbles
from the plastic. After feeding the sleeve into the laminator
(creased-end-first), gently tug on the open end of the sleeve as if you want to
slow down its motion through the laminator. The employees there say that helps
to remove air and improve the lamination quality.

The folding technique I use is to line up the corners, then press one hand down
on the non-creased side (to prevent the corners from moving -- needs significant
force with 60 lb paper) then press vertically down on the other side to create
the crease. I slide fingers up and down the crease (on both sides) to make it as
sharp as possible, then lay the length of my hand down the crease while it
finishes cooling.

## Binding technique

Get some practice on non-laminated paper before using a booklet stapler, as it
is easy to miss the center of the spine (there's no marking on the staplers I've
seen that show exactly were the staple will come out).

I start in the center of the spine, then move towards one side. I then reset
back towards the center and work towards the other side.
