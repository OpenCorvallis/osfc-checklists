# Fabricating the checklists

The checklists are printed and laminated at the FedEx Office Print and Ship
Center on 9th street in Corvallis.

## Possible future changes

The below process was tested and works in practice. However, the print shop
informed me that the printer they have behind the counter can do double-sided
printing on 100lb paper. I plan to try that the next time I make the checklists.
They gave me a couple pieces of advice:

1. Submit the print job online (through FedEx's website) to avoid extra fees.
1. The website will indicate a 3-5 hour turnaround, you can ignore that. The
turnaround is actually 10-15 minutes. It sounds like that's the computer system
delay, and they'll actually print it when you arrive (I'm not 100% sure though).

Oh, and the shop said they will be getting new printers in a few months. They
won't be less capable but they're not sure if the new printers will be more
capable.

## Overview of the fabricating process

1. Print out the checklists, double-sided.
1. Trim the paper edges and cut down the middle.
1. Laminate the checklist pages.
1. As soon as the laminator stops, fold it.
1. Place a heavy book on top while the lamination cools.

## Paper selection

Higher-weight paper is less transparent, which makes it easier to read under
strong light conditions. However, lamination struggles with high-weight paper.
The print shop says they can laminate up to 100 lb paper.

The printers can do automatic double-sided printing on up to 80 lb paper. To
perform double-sided printing on 100 lb paper, we have to print on one side,
flip the paper manually, then print on the other side. The printers at this shop
have significant misalignment: they print the contents off to the side by a
couple millimeters. If you do manual double-sided printing using the normal PDF
(with pages upright), then this will result in the two sides being misaligned
with each other, and you won't have the necessary margins around the crease.
Instead, we use the "print shop" PDF files, which have every even page rotated
180 degrees. The process is:

1. Do a single-sided print of the odd pages in order.
2. Flip the pages over along their long axis (i.e. perpendicular to the axis the
crease will be on).
3. Do a single-sided print of the even pages in order.

The flip in step two flips the pages over, corrects for the 180 degree rotation
of the even pages in the PDF, and reverses the order of the pages (so the first
page is on top), which makes the print work correctly.

The printers are loaded with 20 lb paper. You can purchase the higher-weight
paper from the front desk. You'll have to use the feeder tray to feed the paper,
and there are some special procedures to convince it to use the external feed
slot and to tell it the weight of the paper (ask employees for help if unsure).
To print on 100 lb paper, use the "Heavy 6" preset (heavy 6 and heavy 7 both
support 100 lb paper, I asked them which to use).

For now, I am using 100 lb matte paper. If the lamination's longevity becomes an
issue, then we should reduce to a lighter weight paper (80 pounds or less). In
that case, we should remove the code that generates the "print shop" PDF files
and use the printers' automatic double-sided printing, as that is easier and
aligns the sides better.

## Paper cutting

To correct for the printer's misalignment, use the straight cutter to trim off
excess margins on all sides. Note that you'll have to check both sides to see
what the margins are because they may be misaligned by 1-2 millimeters.

Then chop each page in two down the center (where the crease will be).

## Lamination technique

Double-check the laminator is set to 4.5 (that's normally what it's left at).
Make sure you orient the page in the orientation that will make the fold
easiest; both to make the fold more expedient and to avoid accidentally folding
the checklist in the wrong direction.

Place the two halves of the paper sheet into the plastic, and carefully align
them. You want about a 1 millimeter gap where the crease will be (experimentally
determined), and equal margins all the way around. Make sure the center gap is
perfectly even.

Then feed the sleeve through the laminator. As soon as it stops moving, remove
it and fold it over (before it cools). Try to fold it evenly. Don't try hard to
make the crease happen in the correct place: it will automatically crease at the
1mm gap between the pages (and there's no opportunity to align the corners
during the folding process). Then place a heavy book on top while the lamination
cools.
