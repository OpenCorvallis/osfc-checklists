# Fabricating the checklists

The checklists are printed and laminated at the FedEx Office Print and Ship
Center on 9th street in Corvallis.

## Overview of the fabricating process

1. Print out the checklists, double-sided.
1. Trim the paper edges and cut down the middle.
1. Laminate the checklist pages.
1. As soon as the laminator stops, fold it.
1. Place a heavy book on top while the lamination cools.

## Printing

There is a printer behind the counter (employee use only) that has a much higher
print quality than the customer-use printers (and which can print double-sided
on 100lb paper). According to a store employee, it is cheaper to submit print
jobs online than to give the file to an employee in-store. Therefore, I suggest
submitting the print job online.

Higher-weight paper is less transparent, which makes it easier to read under
strong light conditions. However, lamination struggles with high-weight paper.
This might result in longevity issues. For now, use the heaviest option (100lb
matte cover), but if the lamination doesn't last long enough then we should
reduce to a lighter paper.

The printing should be double-sided, and the paper size is US Letter. I suggest
ordering one more copy than you plan to use, as it's easy to make a mistake
later in the process resulting in a poor-quality checklist.

Currently, there's no option to indicate that the double-sided print should be
flipped along the short edge, nor anywhere to leave a note for the employee
telling them that. If they get to the print job before you get to the store,
they might call you to ask which way it should be flipped.

The website will indicate that the turnaround is several hours (or even the next
day). This is generally inaccurate: they'll likely be able to print it in a few
minutes if that printer is not busy.

## Paper cutting

To correct for the printer's misalignment, use the straight cutter to trim off
excess margins on all sides. Note that you'll have to check both sides to see
what the margins are because they may be misaligned by 1-2 millimeters. Using a
cell phone flashlight to see through the paper is helpful here.

Then chop each page in two down the center (where the crease will be).

## Lamination technique

Double-check the laminator is set to 4.5 (that's normally what it's left at).
Make sure you orient the page in the orientation that will make the fold
easiest; both to make the fold more expedient and to avoid accidentally folding
the checklist in the wrong direction. For me, this is emergency-side-up (so I
fold it like I'm closing a book).

Place the two halves of the paper sheet into the plastic, and carefully align
them. You want about a 1 millimeter gap where the crease will be (experimentally
determined), and equal margins all the way around. Make sure the center gap is
perfectly even.

Then feed the sleeve through the laminator. As soon as it stops moving, remove
it and fold it over before it cools. Try to fold it quickly but evenly (as in,
don't start at the top or the bottom of the crease -- fold the whole page at
once). Don't try hard to make the crease happen in the correct place: it will
automatically crease at the 1mm gap between the pages (and there's no
opportunity to align the corners during the folding process). I've seen the best
results when the fold is complete within 3 seconds of the laminator stopping.
Then place a heavy book on top while the lamination cools.
